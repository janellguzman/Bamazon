# Bamazon

### We are creating an Amazon-like storefront with MySQL called Bamazon. This node app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory list stored in a MySQL database.

The user is asked if they would like to buy anything. If they select 'no', then a simple "Thank you!" is the response. If they type 'yes', they are provided with a list of products that includes Item ID, Product Name, Department Name, Price, and # In Stock of the product. The customer is then asked to enter the Item ID and quantity of that product that they want to purchase.
